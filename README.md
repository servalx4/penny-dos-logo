## What is Penny-DOS?

Penny-DOS is a 16-bit assembly made MS-DOS clone. It is made to be ran in a VM and is purely just for fun, nostalgia, and learning. The name Penny-DOS came from the creator of the project "Penelope" (penny for short).

## When is Penny-DOS?

The official v1.0 release is currently unknown as of Friday, November 7th, 2025. However since most versions are closed source by microsoft other than [these ones here](https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS), it will be harder to do, as version 1.25 alone has *13587 lines of assembly.*, since penny is shooting for a clone of v6.22 it will be harder since we only have internet archives of the `.ISO` files and no source code.
